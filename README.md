Morning Commute
---------------

The main drag of my morning commute is on a stretch of a state highway with about 22 traffic lights on it set at what seems to be completely random red and green intervals. I wondered if given a set of lights, and the ideal situation of a consistent MPH and no other vehicles, at what time a car would need to leave to never hit a red light. 

This Python script creates a semi random "road", set of traffic signals on that road, and a vehicle to travel on it. The vehicle will travel down the road at its (ranomly generated for now) max speed or the speed limit, whichever is lesser. 

Further on, I plan to factor in fuel efficiency and consumption. This will be in terms of mpkWh and other measures geared at electric cars (simply because I'm an EV enthusiast) :)
